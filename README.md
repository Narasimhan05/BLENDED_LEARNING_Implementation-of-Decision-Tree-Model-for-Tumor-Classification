# Implementation of Decision Tree Model for Tumor Classification

## AIM:
To implement and evaluate a Decision Tree model to classify tumors as benign or malignant using a dataset of lab test results.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. **Load Data**  
   Import the dataset to initiate the analysis.

2. **Explore Data**  
   Examine the dataset to identify patterns, distributions, and relationships.

3. **Select Features**  
   Determine the most important features to enhance model accuracy and efficiency.

4. **Split Data**  
   Separate the dataset into training and testing sets for effective validation.

5. **Train Model**  
   Use the training data to build and train the model.

6. **Evaluate Model**  
   Measure the model’s performance on the test data with relevant metrics.
